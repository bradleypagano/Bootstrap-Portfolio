            I have to care about what I write here...  So, I guess I better get this right.  I mean, if I got this wrong, it would be devastating.
            I would prefer not to have to write about myself, but we all have to grow up sometime, right?

            I majored in business management and began to work as a project manager in the 3D printing industry.  After seven years of the same job in different comapnies, 
            I got bored with the job and decided to move into another industry.  Also, the fact that I got fired from the last 3D printing position I held was a good nudge.
            I then went into fiber construction.  This only lasted a couple of years.  I was bored almost immediately.  There wasn't a lot of task, and I was idle most of the time.
            I felt as if my mind was melting away.  Then, I decided to look into coding as something to learn in my downtime.  I started to appreciate the challenge.
            It was almost as I was putting together a puzzle.  I am now enrolled in a boot camp to jump into this new career with both feet.
            I'm being challenged every day, and it's a lot of fun.
